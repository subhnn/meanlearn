      The unforgettable, heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between
      a wealthy boy and the son of his father’s servant, The Kite Runner is a
      beautifully crafted novel set in a country that is in the process of being
      destroyed. It is about the power of reading, the price of betrayal, and
      the possibility of redemption; and an exploration of the power of fathers
      over son

      From the best-selling author of My Seditious Heart and the Ministry of
      Utmost Happiness, a new and pressing dispatch from the heart of the crowd
      and the solitude of the writer's desk. The chant of "Azadi!"—Urdu for
      "Freedom!"—is the slogan of the freedom struggle in Kashmir against what
      Kashmiris see as the Indian Occupation. Ironically, it also became the
      chant of millions on the streets of India against the project of Hindu
      Nationalism. Even as Arundhati Roy began to ask what lay between these two
      calls for Freedom—a chasm or a bridge?—the streets fell silent.
