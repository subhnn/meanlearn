        <p> <b> Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds
          of berries from certain Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the
          seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green
          coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them
          into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into a
          powder and typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out,
          producing a cup of coffee. Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly
          acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its
          caffeine content.It is one of the most popular drinks in the
          world. </b> </p>
