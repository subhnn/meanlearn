        <b> Coffee </b>lovers around the world who reach for their favorite
        morning brew probably aren’t thinking about its health benefits or
        risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of
        debate. In 1991 coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by
        the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research
        found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of
        cancer; on the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers
        among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly
        accounted for. Additional accumulating research suggests that when
        consumed in moderation, coffee can be considered a healthy beverage. Why
        then in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that coffee must bear a
        cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.
